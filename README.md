Amaze - Best Deals on Amazon.ca

IMPORTANT NOTE: The Heroku link is currently not working as a result of Heroku not offering Fier Tier Hosting anymore. 
I will hopefully migrate my website to some other platform as soon as possible. 
Until then you can fork the code and run it on your local machine!

Hello there, welcome!

Are you frustrated that you still have not found the perfect deal on Amazon
even though you have been searching for hours?

Don't worry, Amaze is here to help!

Amaze is a website that extracts product information from Amazon, analyzes the data and lists out the best deals, 
to compensate for Amazonâ€™s own search/filter boxes that have limited functionality.

When you go to the website, you will be met with this page:

To search from Amazon.ca, click the Canadian flag.
To search from Amazon.com, click the American flag.

There are 4 different option to sort the products, providing the most amount of flexibility.
